0.0.8.7:
- added "update-ppa" which can update a single PPA source and not all software sources, useful for those with limited internet connectivity. Usage example: sudo update-ppa ppa:webupd8team/y-ppa-manager . (Thanks to Satya for this feature!)
- when adding a PPA, the new "update-ppa" is used so only that PPA source is updated, not all software sources
- added man pages (thanks Satya)
- fixed launching the PPA Purge feature via command line
- automatically support newer Ubuntu versions (so this means the new version works on Ubuntu Quantal now)
- fixed a bug that was occuring on Linux Mint 13, causing the default version to be set as blank
- Scan for duplicate sources files now displays the number of duplicates found
- the PPA backup feature now backs up / restores repositories keys too (launchpad-getkeys was and is still used to automatically fetch missing keys)
- other minor fixes

0.0.8.4:
- added Ubuntu appindicator: works in stand alone mode (automatically starts when you log in and doesn't require Y PPA Manager to run) or in regular mode: starts when the user opens Y PPA Manager and quits when Y PPA Manager is closed. The appindicator is disabled by default
- renamed NotifyOSD icons to work with KDE too
- use built-in (doesn't require Faenza to be installed) slightly modified Faenza icons for the main UI
- added "import all missing GPG keys"
- added "fix all GPG badsig errors"
- kdesudo integration
- Linux Mint 12 Lisa support
