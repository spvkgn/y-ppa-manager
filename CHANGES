0.0.9.2:
- fixed a bug with search results dialog and apt-get
- implement transient notifications for GNOME Shell
- fix issue with PPA Restore function not working with spaces
- fixed bugs occuring for PPAs with "." or "+" characters in their names
- update-ppa: add support for updating PPAs having older release names
- update-ppa: fix bug with update-ppa not working on Linux Mint
- update-ppa: support for more repository formats (experimental). Examples: update-ppa http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu or update-ppa http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu quantal main
- update-ppa: Support specifying custom codename and section for a ppa. Example: update-ppa ppa:user/repository quantal main
- update-ppa: Download compressed .gz files instead of normal files

- merge "PPA Remove", "List Packages" and "PPA Purge" into a new Manage PPAs dialog
- Manage PPAs: initial support for Launchpad PPAs (only Launchpad!) from /etc/apt/sources.list (experimental). Note: the duplicate PPAs removal, "Re-enable working PPAs after Ubuntu upgrade" and "Update release name in working PPAs" features don't yet support this.
- Manage PPAs: option to view/edit the .list source file
- Manage PPAs: option to update a single PPA
- list PPAs: display the packages for the Ubuntu version available in the .list file, not from the Ubuntu version the user is currently running (it might be different - e.g.: a package is not available in PPA X for Ubuntu Quantal, so an user running Ubuntu Quantal modifies the PPA source file to Ubuntu Precise)
- Manage PPAs: display the actual PPA name (e.g.: ppa:webupd8team/gthumb) in this dialog, instead of the PPA .list file name
- use policykit (pkexec) instead of gksu / kdesu for Ubuntu versions newer than 11.04 (11.04 not included)
- install_package.py should handle errors better


0.0.9.1:
- minor bug fixes

0.0.9.0:
- new "Install packages" item in the main UI that lets you quickly install packages (if you already know the package names). Separate multiple packages with a space. This python script was contributed by Lorenzo from atareao.es
- when you search for packages in Launchpad PPAs, you can select to install some packages directly from the search results dialog - if the PPA isn't already added on your system, it will be added and then the selected package(s) will be installed using the new "Install packages" python script mentioned above, that comes with a GUI, so the user can see if any errors occur.
- a new "PPA status" column in the basic search and advanced search results dialog that lets you know if the PPA is already added on your system or not
- Search results dialog: when searching for a package (in deep search only), Y PPA manager will display its version if it's installed, or it will let you know that the package is not installed.
- Remove duplicate PPA sources: display which PPA sources are duplicates and also, display which PPA sources are about to be removed 

0.0.8.7:
- added "update-ppa" which can update a single PPA source and not all software sources, useful for those with limited internet connectivity. Usage example: sudo update-ppa ppa:webupd8team/y-ppa-manager . (Thanks to Satya for this feature!)
- when adding a PPA, the new "update-ppa" is used so only that PPA source is updated, not all software sources
- added man pages (thanks Satya)
- fixed launching the PPA Purge feature via command line
- automatically support newer Ubuntu versions (so this means the new version works on Ubuntu Quantal now)
- fixed a bug that was occuring on Linux Mint 13, causing the default version to be set as blank
- Scan for duplicate sources files now displays the number of duplicates found
- the PPA backup feature now backs up / restores repositories keys too (launchpad-getkeys was and is still used to automatically fetch missing keys)
- other minor fixes

0.0.8.4:
- added Ubuntu appindicator: works in stand alone mode (automatically starts when you log in and doesn't require Y PPA Manager to run) or in regular mode: starts when the user opens Y PPA Manager and quits when Y PPA Manager is closed. The appindicator is disabled by default
- renamed NotifyOSD icons to work with KDE too
- use built-in (doesn't require Faenza to be installed) slightly modified Faenza icons for the main UI
- added "import all missing GPG keys"
- added "fix all GPG badsig errors"
- kdesudo integration
- Linux Mint 12 Lisa support
